📊 Global Super Store Power BI Dashboard

📝 Project Overview
The **Global Super Store Dashboard** is an end-to-end Power BI reporting project that provides insights into **sales, profit, returns, shipping performance, and customer/product analytics** across different regions and markets.  

This project demonstrates **Power Query transformation,data modeling, DAX calculations and interactive visualization**.

📂 Data Source  
This project uses the **Global Superstore dataset**, available publicly on **Kaggle**:  

🔗 <(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahir1413/global-superstore-2016)  

The dataset contains information on:  
- Orders (Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Customer, Region, Market)  
- Products (Category, Sub-Category, Product Name)  
- Sales metrics (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount, Shipping Cost)  
- Shipping performance (Ship Mode, Delivery Days)
- Returns

🧮 DAX Calculations

📅 Calendar Table  
<pre>
Calendar =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]), MAX(Orders[Order Date])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", MONTH([Date]),
    "YearMonth", FORMAT([Date], "YYYY-MMM"),
    "MonthSort", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "Day", DAY([Date])
)

-- Calculated Columns & Measures --

Shipping Days = DATEDIFF(Orders[Order Date], Orders[Ship Date], DAY)

Avg Delivery Days = AVERAGE(Orders[Shipping Days])

Total Returns = COUNT(Returns[Order ID])

Return Rate = DIVIDE([Total Returns], COUNT(Orders[Order ID]), 0)

Total Sale = SUM(Orders[Sales])

Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

Total Shipped =
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Orders[Ship Date]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(Orders[Ship Date], 'Calendar'[Date])
)

Total Order = COUNT(Orders[Order Date])    
Shipped Variance% = DIVIDE([Total Order]-[Total Shipped],[Total Order],0)
Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Quantity])
Total Discount = SUM(Orders[Discount])
Total Shipping Cost = SUM(Orders[Shipping Cost])
</pre>
